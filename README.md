## What is Campfir?
Campfir is a site that allows users to create, share, and view music playlists.

A user's feed will be an accumulation of songs that were recently added playlists they follow.

A song's entry to a playlist will contains links to YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, Soundcloud, and maybe others. 
This will allow for users to easily access the songs by their preferred medium. 

Creators should be able to create Spotify/YouTube playlist out of their Campfir playlist. 
Likewise, Creators should be able to import playlist into Campfir. 
Every creator has a master playlist that they can just throw songs into.
